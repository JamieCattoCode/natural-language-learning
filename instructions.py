## TASK

## ADDED CONTEXT
**Definition of associations**: The concept of word associations in learning the vocabulary of a new language is a powerful and effective technique. It involves connecting new words to related concepts, images, or words in a language you are already familiar with (often your native language). This method is rooted in cognitive psychology and leverages the way our brains naturally learn and remember information.
